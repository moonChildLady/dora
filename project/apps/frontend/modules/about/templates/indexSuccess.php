		<h4>Dora</h4>
		<p>Dora is an adventurous, bilingual, seven-year-old Latina heroine who lives in a lush, tropical world. Determined, positive, helpful and caring, Dora is always ready for an adventure. She plays soccer on the Golden Explorers team, dances, camps, does gymnastics, and embarks on magical adventures. She’s filled with a sense of wonder and a can-do spirit as she uses her problem-solving skills and her bilingualism to overcome obstacles on her quests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<h4>Boots</h4>
	<p>Dora’s best friend Boots is a furry, fuzzy, five-and-a-half-year-old monkey. He mostly speaks English, but he is learning some Spanish from Dora, as well as at school. Sweet and loving, he likes to take Dora’s hand and follow her lead like a worshipful younger brother. Playful, giggly, and happy, Boots loves making Dora laugh. He is very agile and acrobatic; he loves to run, jump, swing from his tail, and do amazing triple backflips. He lives with his family in a tree house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

	<h4><img class="alignleft" title="Diego" alt="" src="http://www.doralivecanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Diego.jpg" width="141" height="141">Diego</h4>
	<p>Diego is Dora’s eight-year-old cousin, a fellow explorer and an Animal Rescuer who works in the rainforest at the Animal Rescue Center. Athletic, fearless, and determined, Diego jumps at the chance to join Dora on her adventures, especially when they involve helping an animal or protecting the environment. Diego has a scientific mind, a love of nature, a collection of high-tech gadgets, and lots of rescue vehicles. He can often be seen with his best buddy, Baby Jaguar. &nbsp; </p></div>

	<h4>Swiper the Fox</h4>
	<p>Swiper is a quick, sneaky fox who always tries to swipe what Dora needs for her quests. He never keeps what he swipes; he simply throws the object into a hidden picture game before running off. More often, Dora and viewers stop him by saying, “Swiper, no swiping!” Occasionally, we get to see the softer side of Swiper: he’s helped a lost little fox get home, he adores his Grandma, he has a love for puppies, and he has helped Dora return friendship bracelets, fix up Fairytale Land, and more!&nbsp; </p></div>

	<p>Tico is a heroic Spanish-speaking squirrel who often helps Dora save the day with his cars, trains, boats, and planes. He lives with his family, including his many cousins, in the Nutty Forest. He is in the same class at school as Boots, where he is learning English, although he mostly speaks Spanish. He drives many vehicles, including a Nutty Car that actually runs on nuts!&nbsp; </p></div>

	<p>Benny is a comical, strong bull who often needs Dora’s help. He has a hot-air balloon, a go-kart, an impressive collection of toys, and a huge appetite. He lives with his grandma at Benny’s Barn. A “leap before you look” type, he often needs Dora’s help, although sometimes, he’ll help Dora as well.&nbsp; </p></div>

	<p>Isa is Dora’s sweet friend who lives in the Flowery Garden, where she raises exotic plants, silly talking flowers, and vegetables. Isa’s garden is full of surprises; in fact, it hides a rocket ship that Dora and Boots once borrowed for a space adventure! Isa has a bit of an unspoken crush on Boots.</p>
