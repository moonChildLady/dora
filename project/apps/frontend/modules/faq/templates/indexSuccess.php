        <p>This production provides a special musical experience for you and your family. Attending a live theatrical performance enables your child to enjoy their favourite characters in a whole new dimension. We believe that attending the theatre at a young age will lead to a lifelong journey of appreciating and learning through the arts.
Most children are familiar with their favourite characters on television or on the pages of story books. We suggest that you explain that this will be different, as the story will be happening live and in-person. The characters are also a lot larger up close than in books or on TV, so you should prepare them for that. 
<br><br>
Be sure to have fun! We encourage children to participate from their seats and help Dora on her adventure to the City of Lost Toys through clapping, dancing and singing-along.
<br><br>
We do ask that you be safe as well as considerate of those around you.</p>
