<h2 class = 'highlight'>Privacy policy</h2>

<p>Star One Culture Ltd. ("<b>Star One</b>") is concerned about safeguarding your privacy. <br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the <a href='http://www.doralivehk.com' target='_blank'>www.doralivehk.com</a> website to be referred to below as the "<b>Star One Website</b>".
<br>
Star One's Privacy Policy is based upon the following ten basic principles:
</p>

<h2 class='highlight'>Principle 1: Accountability</h2>
<p>Personally identifiable information may include your name, age, address and email address, and if you order tickets or other goods or services your credit card number and expiry date.<br>
Star One is responsible for personally identifiable information under its control. If you wish to contact the individual responsible for the organization's compliance with the following principles and information, he/she can be reached at <a href='mailto:info@starone.hk'>info@starone.hk</a>.<br>
This Star One Website may provide links to other third party websites. These websites operate independently from this Star One Website and therefore any personally identifiable information you give to these other websites is not controlled by our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 2: Identifying Purpose</h2>
<p>The purposes for which personally identifiable information is collected shall be identified on this Star One Website at or before the time the information is collected. Personally identifiable information collected from you for one purpose will not be used for any other purpose without your prior consent.<br>
We do not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information without your prior approval at the place on the Star One Website where we collect the information. On the page where we ask for that information, there is a prominently displayed method to indicate to us that you do or do not want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services and offerings. Please tick the appropriate box and your information may be used as described on the Star One Website: leave it blank, and we consider it an opt-out. Either way, it is always your choice.
</p>


<h2 class="highlight">Principle 3: Consent</h2>
<p>Your knowledge and consent will be required for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personally identifiable information. By providing personally identifiable information, you accept the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
A customer information database is customarily considered a business asset, and Star One shall have the right to transfer this database in a merger, sale, or in an action for bankruptcy, but in all events the use of the database will be subject to this Privacy Policy by any acquiring or merged company.<br>
We may disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its users or others.
</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 4: Limiting Collection</h2>

<p>The collection of personally identifiable information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purpose identified by this Star One Website. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means.<br>
Certain non-personally identifiable information is recorded by our web-servers and hosts, including type of browser being used, its operating system, and domain name, which provide us with aggregate statistics, including number of users to our sites, average length of visit to the sites, etc.
</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 5: Limiting Use, Disclosure And Information</h2>
<p>Personally identifiable information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your prior consent or as required by law. Personally identifiable information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. We may retain your personally identifiable information on our mailing lists for the purpose of providing news, offers, opportunities and similar information to you, until you request to be unsubscribed from such mailing lists.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 6: Accuracy</h2>
<p>Personally identifiable information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. Star One will periodically update its records to keep the information current.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 7: Safeguards</h2>
<p>Personally identifiable information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 8: Openness</h2>
<p>Star One shall make readily available to you specific information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 9: Individual Access</h2>   
<p>Upon request, we will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information and shall be given access to that information. You shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Principle 10: Challenging Compliance</h2>

<p>You shall be able to challenge any inaccuracy in your personally identifiable information being retained by us and have it corrected, and you will be informed as to who the appropriate staff are for hearing such challenges.<br>
Star One may periodically revise its Privacy Policy. You are bound by any such revisions, and therefore we encourage you to visit this page from time to time to review the current terms of our Privacy Policy.
